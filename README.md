# Whiteboarding

... is something I hate. Sure its a bad "hot take", but its also an admission of difficulty: something I've found excruiating for a _loooong_ time. But I'm trying to confront it head-on. In order to overcome _ze imposter syndrome_, this repo tracks the constructive steps I'm taking to get better

## What is this repo?

In this repo, I'm tracking personal answers to whiteboarding questions in order to gain long-term data. I want to see

- What answers I come up with over time for a given question,
- What habbits, misunderstandings, and other patterns become apparent,
- and keep notes (on alternative solutions, alternate versions of the given problem etc.)

all in a place that's more easily accessible to me (and potentially others).

## Personal Notes:

### To-Do:

- [x] Convert this repo to a branched one, with one branch + readme for each problem
- [ ] Check [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/solution/) for alternative "hash" soln
