# Whiteboarding

... was something I didn't like when I was in the early phase of my career. At first, it felt like an arbitrary way to quickly evaluate someone's competancy - arbitrary, because it didn't seem cover one's knowledge of languages, frameworks, etc. I've since seen the error of my ways: I think, if one practices these _in conjunction_ with project work, one can discover new (anti)patterns much more quickly, since you're not preoccupied with "getting the app to work"; the goals are much simplier and more explicit.

## What _is_ this repo?

In this repo, I'm tracking personal answers to whiteboarding questions in order to gain long-term data (and demonstrate my commitment to growth/learning). I want to see

- What answers I come up with over time for a given question - how does my thinking evolve over time,
- What habbits, misunderstandings, and other (anti)patterns become apparent,
- and keep notes (on alternative solutions, alternate versions of the given problem etc.)

all in a place that's more easily accessible.

## What's _in_ the repo?

- "Leet 75" (see branch [Leet 75](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/whiteboarding/tree/main/Leetcode_75)) 
  > a curated problem set to get people up-to-speed with algorithmic whiteboarding on Leetcode.com.
- "Fizz Buzz" (see branch [fizzBuzz](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/whiteboarding/tree/fizzBuzz)) 
  > ongoing meditations on a classic.



## Dev Notes:

#### To-Do:

- [x] Convert this repo to a branched one, with one branch + readme for each problem
- [ ] Check [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/solution/) for alternative "hash" soln
- [x] Start "LeetCode 75" study plan
- [ ] Finish "LeetCode 75" study plan
