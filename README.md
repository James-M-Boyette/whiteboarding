# FizzBuzz

## What is this whiteboarding problem?

As summarized by Rory Spanton,

      The FizzBuzz problem is a classic test given in coding interviews. The task is simple:

      - Print integers 1 to N, but
      - print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by 3,
      - “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5, and
      - “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5

For LeetCode, the description was a bit different:

      Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

      - answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
      - answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
      - answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
      - answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

For the first version of this problem, I'm working on a function that can take in a number array of any size, and return the "fizz buzz" output. In the second, I've writtena function that takes in a number, and then itterates to that number (and returns the "fizz buzz" output).

## What have I learned so far?

- The "modulo" operator ("**%**") is very interesting. I'm trying to further-ingrain my reflexive usage of "truthy" values in conditionals by using this operator.
- Since I first tackled this problem in bootcamp 2021, I've gotten much more comfortable with the modularization of my code - breaking out parts of it into smaller, more-targeted functions (rather than the one, massive, "does everything," amorphous function 😇)
